//Var and Let

//Variables

//Variables associate a name to a value. In Swift, variables are declared with the var keyword.

var height = height = 10
height
//Take a look at the right side of the playground. There, you can see the printed results of the Swift expressions in the playground. Notice that the value of height has changed to 10. As long as you define a variable with the keyword var, you can change its value later on.

//Try declaring your own variables and changing their values in the space below:

// make some variables here!

//The ability of variables to change is called mutability. Declaring a var with a value that never actually changes value will result in the Swift compiler giving you a yellow warning. For those values, you should use a constant instead of a variable.

//Constants

//Constants are immutable, and can not be changed. You can declare a constant using the keyword let:

let pi = 3.14  //Mmm, pi.

//Try changing pi by uncommenting the following line. You can uncomment it by deleting the two forward slashes // at the beginning of the line.

// pi = 2

//Notice that you get an error on that line. This is because you cannot change the value of a constant. Click the error sign to see the following:

//Cannot assign to value: 'pi' is a 'let' constant

//If you've declared a variable using let, you will not be able to change its value later on. To get rid of the error, comment the line again by adding // to the beginning of that line. You can do it quickly with the keyboard shortcut: âŒ˜ + / .

//Create some constants of your own in the space below.

// make some constants here!

//There's two very good reasons you should use constants instead of variables for values that never change. Firstly, it can help prevent bugs that may result from the programmer (you!) accidentally changing a value that you didn't mean to. The second reason is that in some situations, the Swift compiler can do some optimizations with constants that it cannot do with variables, potentially giving your code a small performance boost.

//Naming Variables and Constants

//When naming variables and constants, Swift programmers use a convention called camelCase. Here's how you can follow it:
// Correct
var yourHeight = 5
let upcomingAppVersion = 1.1

// Wrong
var YourHeight = 6
let Upcomingappversion = 1.1

//The rules are as follows:

//Start the first word in the variable name with a lowercase letter.
//Start any subsequent word with an uppercase letter.

//Challenges!


// Write your variables to describe the questions above here.

// 1) Define a variable to hold the number of cars parked in a parking lot, there 4 cars parked at the moment.




// 2) Define variable that holds the number of units in a building on Market St. There 12 units in the building.




// 3) Define a variable that will hold the high score in the new game you are making. The current value is 5000. (You are going to break that score when you finish this tutorial)




// 4) Define a variable that holds the number of letters in the alphabet.
